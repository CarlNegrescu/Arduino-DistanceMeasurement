# Arduino-DistanceMeasurement
A simple yet effective embedded device to help you park your car perfectly in the garage every time. Using an ultrasonic sensor, this project mimics a traffic light, indicating when you're at a safe distance, when you should proceed with caution, and when you need to stop.
